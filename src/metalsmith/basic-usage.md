### Installation

Inside your Metalsmith project, you can install the `datocms-client` package by running these commands:

```bash
$ npm install datocms-client --save-dev
```

If everything worked correctly, you should now run dato and see something like this:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato
Usage:
  dato dump [--token=<apiToken>] [--config=<file>]
  dato -h | --help
  dato --version
```


The main command the `dato` CLI tool exposes is `dump`, which is the one you're going to use to fetch the records from our API and transform them into local files.

You can invoke the command like this:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump --token=READONLY_API_TOKEN
```

You can find your API token in the *Admin area > API tokens* section:

![foo](/images/api-token.png)

#### Passing the API token as environment variable

Instead of specifying the API token as a parameter, you can pass it as an environment variable:

```bash
$ export DATO_API_TOKEN=abc123
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump
```

The CLI tool also loads environment variables from a `.env` file, so you can place the token there and forget about it (just make sure not to publish your `.env` file on Github):

```bash
$ echo '.env' >> .gitignore
$ echo 'DATO_API_TOKEN=abc123' >> .env
$ bundle exec dato dump
```

### The config file

The `dump` command will read a file `dato.config.js` (or the file passed by the `--config` option). This file should contain instructions to transform the content stored remotely in DatoCMS into local files.

Inside this file, you need to export a function that takes three arguments:

* The first argument, `dato`, allows you to get content coming from your administrative area;
* The second argument, `root`, represents the root of your project and makes it easy to create local files and directories;
* The third argument, `i18n`, is useful in multi-language sites to switch between the various available locales and get back translated content;

Let's watch a simple example to get started:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {
  content = {
    hello: "world",
  };
  root.createDataFile("src/data/foobar.yml", "yaml", content)
};
```

Now run `dato dump`:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/dato dump

âœ” Fetching content from DatoCMS...

* Written src/data/foobar.yml
```

Here, `root.createDataFile()` is a method that generates YAML/TOML/JSON files. Inside Metalsmith, you can then read this file with ie. [metalsmith-metadata](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-metadata).

You can also generate Markdown posts with the `root.createPost()` method:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {
  root.createPost(
    "src/articles/first-article.md", "yaml", {
      frontmatter: { 
        title: "First article", 
        category: [ "Random" ] 
      },
      content: "Lorem **ipsum dolor sit amet**, consectetur adipiscing elit."
    }
  );
};
```

If you need to place a collection of posts within a folder, you can use the `root.directory` method, so that every time the `dump` command is executed, **previous content of the directory will be erased**:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {

  // inside a "src/articles" directory...
  root.directory("src/articles", (articlesDir) => {

    // ...let's write 10 markdown articles, complete with frontmatter
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

      articlesDir.createPost(
        `article-${i}.md`, "yaml", {
          frontmatter: { 
            title: `Article ${i}`, 
            category: [ "Random" ] 
          },
          content: "Lorem **ipsum dolor sit amet**, consectetur adipiscing elit."
        }
      );
    }
  });
};
```

The above structure is exactly what is needed by the [metalsmith-markdown](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-markdown) and [metalsmith-collections](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-collections) plugins.

Now that you know how you can create local files, the final step is to start generating them with data coming from DatoCMS. The first argument called `dato` is available exactly for this purpose:

```javascript
// dato.config.js

module.exports = (dato, root, i18n) => {

  // inside a "src/articles" directory...
  root.directory("src/articles", (articlesDir) => {

    // ...iterate over the "Blog post" records...
    dato.blogPosts.forEach((article) => {

      // ...and create a markdown file for each article!
      articlesDir.createPost(
        `${article.slug}.md`, "yaml", {
          frontmatter: { 
            title: article.title, 
            category: article.categories.map(cat => cat.name)
          },
          content: article.content
        }
      );
    });
  });
};
```

Once your `dato.config.js` is ready, just run the `dato dump` command: you should see your Metalsmith project populated with new files.

Obviously, that's just a quick tour: you can learn all the details about how to access your records inside your config file in the following sections.
